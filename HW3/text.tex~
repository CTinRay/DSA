\begin{document}
This is a basic XeLaTeX document, which will be processes using the {\stressed xelatex} program.
This means that as long as the document source is in {\stressed UTF-8} encoding,
XeLaTeX {\stressed doesn't care} what you actually wrote.

For instance, we can write in English, or in Japanese ({\exotic 日本語}), or in Thai 
({\exotic ภาษาไทย}), or in Vietnamese ({\exotic tiếng Việt}), or any other number of languages.

It can even be used for non-languages that are in {\stressed Unicode},
such as mathematical operators (like {\math √ {\maintext and} ∞}). % maintext inside math!
